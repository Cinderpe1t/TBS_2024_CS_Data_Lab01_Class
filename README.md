# 2024 CS Algorithm and Data Structure Lab #1 - Class
First lab for CS Algorithm and Data Structure course. Practice class, inheritance, and object-oriented programming.
## Python code
`python3 lab01_final.py`
## Interface and screenshot
- Satellites always orbit circularly. It has exaggerated gravitational force and electric force when charged. Their orbits are not affected by any force. When added by clicking, the new satellite will orbit cicularly around the center of the box. 
- Balls are limited to the screen box. It is subject to gravitational and electric force.
- Satellite and ball can have positive, negative, or neural charge.
- Field meters in grid shows gravitation force (blue), electrical force (red) and net force (black)
- Basic physics engine models simple elastic bouncing
